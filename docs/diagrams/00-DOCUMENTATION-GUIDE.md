- Acumatica CRM is limited - it can't do training tracking, engineer ratings, workflows.

**Or:**
- Build exactly what you need for $445K over 5 years
- Get features that are IMPOSSIBLE in off-the-shelf systems
- Own it forever - no vendor lock-in
- Live in 3-4 months
- ROI in 10-12 months

The choice is obvious."

## 🎯 Objection Handling

### "Salesforce is proven, Custom is risky"
**Response**: 
- Salesforce is proven for Fortune 500. You're $50M.
- We've done this before (Honest Water case study)
- You own the code - if we fail, hire anyone to continue
- Dynamics was "proven" too - you spent $600K and it failed

### "Acumatica CRM is included with our ERP"
**Response**:
- It's not really a CRM, it's ERP with contact list
- Can't do training tracking, engineer ratings, workflows
- No mobile app, no automation
- You'd still need separate CRM (which means paying for both)

### "We don't have time for another project"
**Response**:
- 12-16 weeks vs 6-12 months for others
- Every day you wait, you lose $200+/day in wasted labor (19 hrs/week)
- Continue with broken Dynamics? That's even more time wasted

### "What if you go out of business?"
**Response**:
- You own the source code
- Hosted on your Azure account
- Documented extensively
- Any developer can maintain it
- Dynamics/Salesforce? You're locked in forever
