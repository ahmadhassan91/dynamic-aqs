## 💰 The Money Story

**What You're Spending Now:**
- $600K spent on Dynamics (sunk cost)
- $150K-300K/year ongoing
- 19 hours/week manual CRM work = $50K/year wasted

**What Custom CRM Costs:**
- Year 1: $170K (build + launch)
- Year 2+: $58K-80K/year
- <2 hours/week manual work = $5K/year

**Savings:**
- **$855,000 over 5 years** vs Dynamics
- **$355,000 over 5 years** vs Acumatica CRM
- **$1,045,000 over 5 years** vs Salesforce

**ROI: Break-even in 10-12 months**

## 🚫 Why Dynamics Failed (You Know This)

1. ❌ Parent/child **BROKEN** for 2+ years
2. ❌ Can't track trainings - VP can't report
3. ❌ No Acumatica integration - manual entry for everything
4. ❌ No engineer ratings - can't prioritize relationships
5. ❌ Data inaccurate - CRM ≠ ERP (~70% accuracy)
6. ❌ Manual reports - hours in Excel
7. ❌ Poor UX - team complains, low adoption
8. ❌ Expensive - $600K spent, still doesn't work

**Why?** Generic tool trying to fit your unique HVAC manufacturing business.

---

## 🚫 Why Acumatica CRM Isn't Enough

**Tempting because:**
- Same database as ERP
- Cheaper than others
- Already using Acumatica ERP

**But reality:**
- ❌ No training tracking
- ❌ No engineer rating system
- ❌ No parent/child hierarchies
- ❌ No workflow automation
- ❌ No proper mobile app
- ❌ ERP-focused UI, not CRM-focused
- ⚠️ You'd still need separate CRM for real relationship management

**Verdict:** Good for viewing ERP data, bad for managing relationships. **You'd end up with Acumatica CRM + something else anyway.**

---

## 🚫 Why Salesforce Is Overkill

**Good for:**
- Fortune 500 companies
- 1000+ users
- Companies with dedicated Salesforce admins

**Bad for Dynamic AQS:**
- ❌ Costs 3x more ($1.5M vs $445K)
- ⚠️ Training tracking - expensive custom development
- ⚠️ Engineer ratings - expensive custom development
- ⚠️ Acumatica integration - 6+ month project
- ❌ Per-user licensing - expensive to scale
- ❌ Over-engineered - 90% of features you won't use
- ⚠️ Requires Salesforce consultant - ongoing expense

**Verdict:** Like buying a Ferrari to drive to the grocery store. **Expensive overkill.**

## ✅ Why Custom CRM Wins

### 1. Solves Problems That Are IMPOSSIBLE Elsewhere

**Training Tracking:**
- ✅ Schedule, track, report on trainings
- ❌ MS Dynamics: IMPOSSIBLE

**Engineer Rating System (1-5):**
- ✅ Visual stars, full history, "who to focus on?" dashboard
- ❌ MS Dynamics: Not available
- ❌ Acumatica CRM: Not available
- ⚠️ Salesforce: Basic custom field only (no UI, no analytics)

**Parent/Child Roll-ups:**
- ✅ Working perfectly, unlimited levels
- ❌ MS Dynamics: **BROKEN** (you've lived this for 2 years)
- ❌ Acumatica CRM: Not available
- ✅ Salesforce: Works (but costs 3x more)

**Real-time Acumatica Integration:**
- ✅ Purpose-built, webhooks, <1 min lag
- ❌ MS Dynamics: **ZERO** (19 hrs/week manual entry)
- ⚠️ Acumatica CRM: Same DB but limited CRM functionality
- ❌ Salesforce: 6+ month custom project

## ❓ Questions to Ask Other Vendors

### For Salesforce Rep:
- "Can you show me training tracking like this? What's the cost?"
- "Can you show me an engineer rating system with analytics?"
- "How long to integrate with Acumatica ERP? What's the cost?"
- "What's the TOTAL cost for 100 users over 5 years, including customization?"
- "If we leave, can we take our code?"

### For Acumatica CRM:
- "Can you show me training tracking and reporting?"
- "Can you show me parent/child organization roll-ups?"
- "Can you show me workflow automation for onboarding?"
- "Can you rate engineers 1-5 and track history?"

**They can't. These features don't exist.**

---

## 💡 The Closing Argument

**You've already spent $600K on Dynamics and it doesn't work.**

**You have three choices:**

1. **Keep Dynamics** - Continue spending $260K/year, 19 hrs/week manual work, broken features
2. **Buy Salesforce** - Spend $1.5M over 5 years, still need expensive customization for your unique needs
3. **Build Custom CRM** - Spend $445K over 5 years, get EXACTLY what you need, own it forever

**The math is clear. The choice is obvious.**

---

## 🏆 Bottom Line

**Custom CRM:**
- ✅ Solves problems that are IMPOSSIBLE in Dynamics/Acumatica
- ✅ Saves $855,000 over 5 years vs Dynamics
- ✅ Built exactly for HVAC manufacturing (residential + commercial)
- ✅ Real-time Acumatica integration (finally!)
- ✅ You own it forever, no vendor lock-in
